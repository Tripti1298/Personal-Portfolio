# Personal-Portfolio
The related files include all the html and css styling. In my code I have done the styling of html in separate files of css to make it more convenient for myself.
The portfolio includes four main pages namely:  1-) ABOUT
                                                2-) SKILLS
                                                3-) PROJECTS
                                                4-) EDUCATION
INSTRUCTIONS TO FOLLOW:
1-) All the pages have the link embedded in them to be redirected towards the home page.
2-) Open all the files with the html and css extensions only the rest are the images in the jpeg format used for coding.
3-) Open with line server from visual studio code . As the styling may not be visible otherwise. As i had created this in visual code environment i had kept in mind that only.
